# LC-2 Execises
> 💻 From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond...

A series of execises for the Computing Systems course of "Sicurezza dei Sistemi e delle Reti Informatiche".  

Each .asm program can be compiled with "Litte Computer 2" (LC-2) simulator, an educative  simple computer used to
introduce general-purpose computing devices to first-year engineering students with no previous background in computer architecture or
logic design. 

A complete documentation reference of LC-2 architecture and its ISA can be found here:
